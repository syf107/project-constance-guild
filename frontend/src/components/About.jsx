      <h1>About Constance Guild</h1>
      <p>
        Forged in the fires of the Dark Era, the Constance Guild was founded by
        three legendary warriors—a human, an elf, and an orc—who defied fate to
        bring peace to a world consumed by chaos. Named after the one thing that
        must endure—constancy—the guild stands as a beacon of strength, unity,
        and unwavering resolve. For centuries, adventurers from all walks of
        life have gathered under its banner to fight, protect, and rise
        together. This is where legends are made. Will you be one of them?
