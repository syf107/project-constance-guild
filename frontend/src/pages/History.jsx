      <h1>The History of Constance Guild</h1>
      <p>
        In the annals of time, when darkness threatened to consume the world,
        three warriors—bound not by blood, but by an unbreakable bond—stood
        against the tide. A <strong>human</strong>, an <strong>elf</strong>, and
        an <strong>orc</strong>, once strangers, became legends. They were known
        as the <strong>Heroes of the Dark Era</strong>, the only ones who dared
        to rise when all others had fallen.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was an age of war and ruin, where monsters roamed freely, and the
        lands trembled beneath their fury. Cities crumbled, and hope waned like
        the last embers of a dying fire. Yet, amidst the chaos, these three
        warriors fought side by side, their differences set aside for a cause
        far greater than themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the war was won, and the shadows pushed back into the abyss, they
        made a vow:
        <strong>
          {" "}
          "Strength alone may win battles, but unity wins wars."{" "}
        </strong>
        From this promise, the <strong>Constance Guild </strong> was born—a
        beacon of stability in an ever-changing world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "Constance" was chosen with purpose. In a world ruled by
        violence and uncertainty, there needed to be something unwavering,
        steadfast, and eternal. The guild would be that pillar, a place where
        adventurers of all races could stand together, not as enemies, but as
        comrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        For hundreds of years, the Constance Guild has upheld its founders’
        ideals. It has nurtured countless warriors, defended the weak, and
        ensured that no adventurer ever stands alone against the darkness. The
        legacy of the three heroes lives on—not in stone or song, but in the
        hearts of those who fight under the guild’s banner.

        And so, we remain. <br />
        <strong>We fight. We protect. We endure.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to the Constance Guild.</strong> ⚔️🔥
